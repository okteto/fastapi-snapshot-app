# Use Volume Snapshots to Create Development Environments with Real Data

This is an example of a [FastAPI](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi) application that uses Okteto's Volume Snapshots to initialize Development Environments with pre-existing data. Okteto Volume Snapshots allow you to initialize your development environments with data from a previously created snapshot. This is useful when working with large datasets or when you need to create Development Environments with realistic data from production or staging without having to manually copying databases or execute error-prone seed scripts.

This is the application used for the [Use Volume Snapshots to Create Development Environments with Real Data](https://www.okteto.com/docs/tutorials/create-and-use-volume-snapshots/) tutorial.
